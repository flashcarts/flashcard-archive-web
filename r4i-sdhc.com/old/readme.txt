r4i-sdhc.com_R4i_Upgrade_no-version_DEMON_1.12d should only be used on r4i-sdhc.com's R4i Upgrade flashcarts - these do not have a version number on them.

r4i-sdhc.com_DEMON_1.87b does not contain a timebomb and should be the version you use if you do not want to use YSMenu.
r4i-sdhc.com_DEMON_1.85b contains a timebomb which expires on September 3rd, 2024.
r4i-sdhc.com_DEMON_1.85b-notimebomb is the same kernel with the timebomb removed, clone checks removed and the bouncing WiFi icon removed.
    - This kernel has an issue where some games - mainly Pokemon games - will boot up to a white screen. 
    - You should ideally use the 1.87b kernel where the timebomb has been removed by the manufacturer and doesn't appear to affect game compatibility.
