Since the normal Stargate DS mode is not accessible when CFW like Luma3DS is installed, this launcher cia provides a way to use the cart on modded systems, by packaging the cart's kernel as a launchable .cia.

Simply install the provided `SG_Launcher.cia` using FBI, and then launch it to use Stargate's DS mode.
