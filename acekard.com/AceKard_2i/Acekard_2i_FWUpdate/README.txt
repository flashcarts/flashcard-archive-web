Notes on AK2i Firmware Updates:

This folder is ordered in the versions that the firmware update was released. Thus, DSi1.4.0 would be the first firmware update, and the bottom of the list is the last.

Acekard 2i firmware updates are known to cause boot time issues. However, back in the day it was the only way to overcome Nintendo's blacklists. But that isn't really relevant now.

Here are a few options:

1. Flash ntrboot. This will replace the spoofed game with ntrboot, but it will also retain compatibility with the regular DS mode so you can have the best of both worlds at the same time. This is probably the best solution especially if you have a 3DS family console. As the spoofed game is not required, boot times are near instant.
1. Downgrade to the original firmware update. This even restores the Acekard 2i logo in the main DS menu! It will also drastically improve boot time, if you were on the latest firmware. This will also require CFW on any DSi or 3DS as the cart will no longer run on stock latest system version.

These folders also have different game headers. If you didn't like the game that shows up on your main menu before launching the cartridge, you can pick a firmware update and flash it. Refer to https://gbatemp.net/threads/482115/ for more info.
